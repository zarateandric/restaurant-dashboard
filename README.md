# üìä Dashboard - Restaurant Data Analysis with Power BI
---
## üìÑ Project Description
This repository documents the creation of an **interactive Dashboard for a restaurant**, fully developed in **Power BI**.
The main goal was to transform raw sales and operations data into actionable insights, utilizing key tools such as **Power Query** for data preparation and **DAX formulas** for creating advanced metrics.

## üìÅ Main Project Files
* `Restaurante-Dashboard.pbix`: Main Power BI Dashboard file.
* `Restaurante Redux, Power BI, Datos.xlsx`: Source data file (Excel) used for loading into Power BI.
---
## üõ†Ô∏è Key Development Steps
1.  **Data Import:** Loading Excel files into Power BI.
2.  **Data Modeling:** Establishing relationships (models) between the different tables.
3.  **Cleaning and Transformation (Power Query):**
    * Cleaning and standardization of columns.
    * **Table Merge:** A *merge* was performed between two key tables to consolidate historical information, resulting in a new **Historicals** table (necessary due to the original data structure).
4.  **Metric Creation (DAX):** Development of calculated measures for analysis.
    * **Calculated Table:** Creation of a new table using `SUMMARIZE` to facilitate specific analyses.
5.  **Bi-directional Relationship:** A bi-directional filter relationship was implemented between the new calculated table and the Historicals table (‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: This implementation is included with the warning that its use should be limited and well-justified due to potential impacts on performance and model ambiguity.*).
6.  **Dashboard Design:** Implementation of visuals, charts, and formatting for a clear and functional presentation.

## üìà DAX Formulas Used
* `SUM`
* `CALCULATE`
* `DIVIDE`
* `TOTALYTD`
* `SUMMARIZE`
* `COUNTA`
* `AVERAGEX`

## üé® Implemented Visualizations

The final Dashboard utilizes a variety of visuals to represent the data:

* **Cards**: For Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
* **Multi-row Cards**: For detailed summaries.
* **Clustered Column Charts**
* **Line Charts**: For trend analysis.
* **Bar Charts** (Horizontal/Lying Columns)
* **Matrices**: For detailed tabular views.
* **Maps**: For geographical analysis (if applicable).
* **Scatter Charts**
* **KPI Cards**
* **Buttons/Navigation**
